Hi üëãüèΩ, I'm Achuth. I'm a software engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area, currently working at Google on API platforms and security. Previously, I worked on big data processing systems at Qubole, focusing on Apache Spark optimization and security.

Over the years, I've built systems across various domains - from API management platforms to machine learning pipelines, from traffic prediction engines to caching frameworks. I enjoy working with Java, Python, Go and distributed systems, particularly when solving interesting data processing challenges.

I have a Master's in Computer Science from SUNY Buffalo and started my tech journey with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from SRM University, India.
This blog is where I share my personal projects and explorations in technology.

All opinions and content here are my own and not associated with my work at Google.
